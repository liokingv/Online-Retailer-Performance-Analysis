# Online-Retailer-Performance-Analysis
 ## Project Scope
An online retailer has tasked me with helping them measure their website and analyze their website's performance. The retailer uses Google Analytics (GA) to track engagement and conversion on their website. I have been given two GA datasets containing basic ecommerce metrics and asked to summarize website performance and provide insights to help the retailer understand their websiteâ€™s performance.

## Overview
This repo includes python code for EDA of two datasets (Adds to carts data and session data) and plots. Also included is a sample client deck which will summarize "key takeaways".
